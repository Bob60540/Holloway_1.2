THE LIBERATED SONNET

Old Shakespeare was a chauvinistic wimp
Who played most foul with done-wrong maids and wives.
Deliberate and crass, he slipped a crimp
In all his biased roles of female lives.
His churlish answers to their puckered throes
Like "Get thee to a nunnery," mocked truth
And worthiness; he reveled in their woes.
His ghost be plagued and plagiarized forsooth!

He bowdlerized, victimized girls with verve,
Made 'em losers and gofers, goofers, all.
The few he permitted a bit of nerve
Found themselves spondeed on masculine gall.

I refuse to confirm the final bane
Of his namesake form; I will not contain
My righteous rant in gilded gelded couplet.
I'm out to reform his metric quintuplet.

My wrath will not be bound, my spleen is full
Of sand, and furry-- trocheed by a male.
Julie skips Act IV in the latest tale.

No more sexist machinations and chicane.
No more will I endure a macho Moor or Dane.
No more inversions or half-rhymed aspersions.
Poetic justice has to come--

Observe my liberated thumb!


THE STAR SALESMAN

I'm native to this territory's scene
Like mini-calculators, cabs and booze.
I sprawl the king-size hotel bed and stare,
My all-wool alter ego hangs alert,
Fresh pressed and waiting for the morning's cue.
My forty dollar name-designer tie
Most likely has a spot that must be sponged
Before I sleep. My Gucci shoes are shined
For each rehearsed approach. But there's no role
For sweet success tomorrow. Or next week.

A dozen times a month I play this lead--
Instead of hotdogs, dine on haute cuisine.
The bottom line is (How I hate that line!)
Our customers aren't clapping for our number.
However primped and powdered or threadbare
They make it sound, their script says NO, a word
Of lead and ice that lodges in soft parts
Beneath my vest, attacking gourmet spoils.
(I'm sure you note the comic undertones
That permeate this neo-classic farce.)
Still, I provide expected locomotion
For this fine costume to complete the plot,
To make the entrance and escort the client
To lunch, silk lining iridescing wit,
Lapels weli-tailored with sincerity,
Pants creased with confidence. Bright anecdotes
Emerge from pockets, practiced protocol
And uptown jokes, a little charge card magic--

Then when the show plays out, the wound-up mime
Propels the props to yesterday's airport.
And there this woven retinue, almost
Adept enough to give its own performance
Will go inanimate back in the plane,
At last unfolding in home's terminal
To wait in line in Ma Bell's crowded alley,
And from the slept-in depths yield change enough
To call~- report the bust to amateur
Directors of these high-camp one-act flops--
And maybe learn I don't still head the cast.


ON MAKING THE RIVER AN OLD MAN

The river was an athlete sprinting south,
A whistling boy with rhythmic summer stride.
The settlers drew cool sweetness from his mouth,
And made themselves spectators on his side.
Efficiently he handled rain and thaw;
He grew their wheat and cotton into fame.
His flanks became a city; all who saw
Made plans to say, and daily, others came.
Pure drinking-- mallards-- trout-- were not enough.
Machines re-routed him, they built a dam.
They stole his power, dumped their poison-stuff,
Then cursed him for the filth where once they swam.
Now reeking by, a progress refugee,
He seeks a nameless burial at sea. 


THE ANSWERING
A Sequal to Browning's Evelyn Hope

Because no one has ever spoken
Back from here, we've all supposed
This colding seal remains unbroken,
This ancient passage always closed.
If only you who think I died
Could know this is a sweet exchange,
Could know how boundaries fade inside
The spectrum's unimagined range!

You never would have come to me
Had I remained a normal length
In mortal phase. Oh, can you see
The structured weave, the narrow strength
Of patterns granting us a place
In that frame's weft? A giddy girl,
A proper gentleman of grace
In middle years allowed to purl

Into the fabric of acceptance?
Not while I lived, but only after,
Could you speak this without the chance
Of shock, rebuke, or even laughter.
Like you, I never dared express
My secret. Silly child, you might
Have thought. But by this leaf you press
Into my hand, we will unite.

Don't grieve, my dear, your words are not
Earthbound. I hear your lover's heart
With mine and don't despair our lot.
New dimensions reweave my part
As they will yours at your last breath.
The cycling portals pivot and spin
On far-off stars that hinge on death--
An old wronged term that means begin.

And by your token I transmit
My pledge through leaf-veined stillness;
We'll meet renewed, a better fit
With time, my touch free of chillness.
It's fitting that my name was Hope--
Please never abandon its muffled call
No matter how long transition's scope.
Here, time is nothing; love is all.


OBLIQUE RHYME FOR THE GARDEN WE CAN'T FORGET

Having found it by being lost
I don't know if we can ever go back.
A gardener yourself, this won't bore you, at least.
Actually, we were following an antler-shedding buck.
By the time we picked up the left side of his regal rack
we'd wandered to an unknown spot ~
overgrown with corruption and the stinging reek
of grotesque excrescence with the breath of spite
and rot. We fled that oozing nightmare .
but just as in a terror dream, each step
was hobbled by conspiracies of roots and mire.
Hulking forms of fungus made us stoop
as they reached to slime our hair.
Scratched and gasping, we came to a clearing;
fog isolated us, but we could hear
frantic groans and thrashes declaring
same animal (likely the buck) was trapped
in that hideous bog. The mist began to disappear.
Our feet stopped sinking. Then we tripped
on stones fallen from an old wall in disrepair.
When we stood and raised our eyes
lilacs surrounded us. A heart-shaped leaf
brushed my face. Our lungs filled with ease;
sweetness cleansed our tainted mouths. Allness of life
combined iris purpling together with asters. Sky-shine
laced petals and panicles, stippled the moss-napped floor
with sueded negatives of sun. Iridescent sheen
-on shades of cinnabar and carnelian in a flower
never seen before drew us ahead. Wherever
we turned was beauty: Rhododendrons of maroon and coral,
thornless roses, a night-bloaming cereus by day. Over
and under florescence we moved, accompanied by a chorale
of posing birds. There were no paths, just solid bloon,
yet our feet walked unimpeded. Nothing was random or wild
but there was no pattern or restriction-- only sublime
existence, glory of being, natural but willed.
The master gardener left no trace of rake, pruning shears,
no shriveled calyx, mulch or stakes to mar perfection.
Maybe we'll find it again-- hidden behind old shores—-
But of this much we're sure, he and I-- Eden wasn't fiction.

CUTTING A FINGER ON OBSIDIAN to Georgia O'Keeffe

Searching,
plodding in sand-filled shoes
through shimmers of heat,
we never met.
Yet I knew you, Georgia,
in veinous ways--

mirrors in the secret vaults

Exclaiming aloud and alone

You are willful and wild

You are hands   brushes   eyes
no longer peeling light,

shedding it like snakeskin

THE MAKING OF AN ANGEL

Walking the lush green canopy of the Peruvian rainforest 
beneath his wings, Carl Mortenson used to imagine the tall
vertical spikes it concealed. "Telephone pole jungle," bush pi-
lots called it. A plane could plunge out of sight and never reach
the ground. If the only engine failed, there was no alternative.
"Even if a pilot lived through the crash, he'd probably never get
out of the jungle alive, in spite of all the survival training,"
says;Carl.

During the 50s and 60s as a missionary pilot with Jungle
Aviation and Radio Service (JAARS), the air arm of Wycliffe Bible
Translators, Carl was also well-acquainted with other problems:
Heavily loaded take-offs and landings on short, uneven, sometimes
rocky and muddy airstrips. And trying to decide whom or what to
leave behind when the cramped cargo space was full. "Light
single-engine aircraft are used because that's about all that can
get into those primitive places. There's never been a plane that
was really right for the job," he says. "I believe God meant for
me to change that. I believe that's why He spared my life. Twice,
in fact. The first time I was just a kid. My appendix ruptured
and there weren't any wonder drugs back then. I had peritonitis
and a long bout with other infections besides. A couple of times
the doctors told my parents I wouldn't live through the night.
When I made it-- after nine months and five operations-- I was
sure the Lord had a reason. But at the time I figured, well,
maybe He wants me to preach. Later I realized I wasn't cut out
for the pulpit."

The second time was shortly after his arrival in Peru with
JAARS. He was stricken with bulbar polio. He knew if he lived he
would likely be paralyzed and confined to an iron lung. One was
wheeled into his hospital room. He stared at it. "I told the Lord
I'd rather die than live that way but if He still had some use
for me, I'd accept His will. I knew He'd led me there, but I
thought He might've changed His mind. Whatever His answer, I was
sure He wouldn't abandon me." Six months later, Carl Mortenson
passed his flight physical.

But all the while he was in the hospital, he was designing an
airplane in his head: A twin engine job that would be the answer
to a missionary's prayers: STOL (short take-off and landing)
capabilities. Easy repair and maintenance in the field. More
cargo-passenger space. And that life-saving second engine.

In 1965, with no engineering experience, he put his design on
paper and named his plane the Evangel. Eventually, eight of them
were built by a small corporation. All but one are still in
service. But the company dissolved, and production ended with
three orders unfilled. In spite of disappointment and dis-
couragement, Carl began to understand that the Evangel was just a
forerunner. There was much about it that he knew he could im-
prove. "The truth is, God wouldn't let me quit. Newer aerodynamic
technology had come along-- like full-span flaps for maximum
lift, spoilers instead of ailerons to control roll. Besides, a
more attractive appearance was needed. The Evangel was a boxy
workhorse. Streamlining also boosts efficiency."

Wycliffe eventually granted Carl and his wife an extended
leave of absence and in 1972 the successor began to take shape on
his drawing board. Over 950 drawings and 11,500 hours of engin-
eering went into this first and most tedious step. It was
completed Christmas night, 1976, and presented by the whole
family-- Carl, his wife, Alice, sons, Edward, Evan, and Daniel,
and daughters, Evangeline and Betsy-- as a gift to God for His
use. "Without their help, devotion and sacrifices-- all the
things they did and did without-- I couldn't have done any of
this," Carl says humbly.

What he has done-- mostly in his basement, garage and laundry
room-- is to proceed from piles of paper to ribs, dies, moulds,
angles, jigs and a fuselage of aluminum and fiberglass which have
materialized into an airplane called the Angel. "Angels are God's
messengers to mankind," says Carl. "This plane is being developed
specifically to spread God's Good News to those ‘uttermost parts
of the earth.' Cheaper, faster and more safely than ever before.
Mission outposts are often hundreds of miles from the supply
base. In Peru, the nearest is 90, the farthest is 600. The
average range of a single-engine light plane is 350 miles. The
Angel can fly 1600 miles without refueling. It cruises at 200
mph. It can carry over a ton of cargo, eight people or four 55
gallon drums. It can land and take off in 600 feet. The mission-
ary's air isn't any rougher than other pilots’ but his landings
sure are. So the Angel's landing gear is designed to handle soft
ground conditions, keep the wheel from caking with mud, and to
deflect rocks. No other light multi-engine plane being produced
has all these features."

Carl's youngest son, Dan, who has taken over correspondence
and public relations says passionately, "The Angel's first
priority is safety. When a missionary pilot is killed, even if
he's alone, it's not just one life and a plane and Bibles or
supplies that are lost. It's all the training and time that went
into his being there-- and worse, all the people who may be lost
forever before he can be replaced to deliver the means for saving
them. Also there are still many areas that have Sager. Beet
reached because they're so remote. The Angel can get there.
That's why this project is so important."

Funding comes from donations to the King's Engineering Fellow-
ship in Orange City, Iowa where the Mortensons live and work on
the Angel, and the "Back To The Bible Broadcast" in Lincoln,
Nebraska. The largest donors have been missionary pilots them-
selves. Some have given many hours of labor as well.

Lack of manpower was a constant problem from the beginning.
Periodic reports had to be made to the Federal Aviation Authority
for certification. And always the need for money. "Airplanes are
like pelicans," Carl often says, "they come with big bills." His
sons were good help but they had education to complete and also
had to work at paying jobs. "But each time things reached the
impossible stage, the Lord provided-- more money, and sometimes
special people for short periods-- a retired aeronautical en-
gineer from American Rockwell, an interested Pan Am pilot,
another pilot-mechanic from JAARS between assignments, a retired
electrical engineer, college kids, even a highschooler-- they all
put in much appreciated work. Whatever we needed most, always
arrived.”

Illinoisan Douglas Muir, one of the early volunteer hands
says, "It was a pleasure working with Carl. He was so patient
with me-- teaching me what I had to know before I could be of
help. I admire his stick-to-itiveness. Most people couldn't have
continued with anything so demanding."

On Good Friday, 1979, the Angel's 40 foot, 600 pound wingspan
was hauled outside for a photograph. It was a joyful occasion
because the most difficult part of the plane had been built along
with the tooling for future production.

At last a local builder, a financial co-op, plumbing and elec-
trical tradesmen, the use of equipment, all came together as a
team for constructing a hangar-shop at the airport for completion
of the Angel and its descendants when certification is complete.
Carl turned from aeronautics to carpentry. In snow and below zero
weather, the long awaited workplace became reality. In 1982,
Merle Brown, a retired pilot-mechanic from New Tribes Mission
joined the team as a regular. "Brownie's our maintenaince crew
chief and walking mechanical reference system," Dan annonces
proudly.

In January 1984, the FAA cleared Angel for flight testing. All
experimental aircraft are full of bugs. Even big manufacturers
with large engineering staffs sometimes lose their planes and
crews during flight testing. The Mortensons asked for special
prayers for safety, skill and good judgement. They also prayed
for (and received) good runway conditions-- no icing, no deep
snowbanks on either side. Many short, low take-offs and landings
were necessary for checking stability and controlability. Carl
says First Chronicles 4:10 (Living Bible) summed up their
feelings: "Oh, that you would wonderfully bless me and help me in
my work; please be with me in all that I do, and keep me from all
evil and disaster!"

The Angel flew. Of course there were problems, but it flew.
With Carl's oldest son, Ed, in his final year at Iowa State
University, they were able to use ISU's wind tunnel to select a
better design for the nacelle, the fiberglass skin enclosing each
engine. The new shape increased speed. “Every improvement will
benefit missionary Angels in the future through many years of
service, This is what drives us," says Carl.

When Ed graduated from Iowa State, his professors voted him
the most likely to succeed as a design engineer. In spite of the
highly paid opportunities avaliable, he elected to invest his
talents in the Angel. "So instead of making the most money, I'll
make the least," he smiles. "But this is the job and these are
the people I love. I don't feel I'm making any sacrifice at all."

"None of us is in it for the bucks," says Carl. "This is God's
project. The plane should have commercial appeal in Alaska and
the developing countries. All such sales will subsidize more
missionary Angels. We'll be able to provide a free missionary
plane for each four or five planes sold on the general market.
That's why we're keeping it a simple do-it-yourself fellowship.
No stockholders, no corporate structure. Any profits will be
passed on to fly more Angels to more people who don't know
Christ."

Carl's middle son, Evan, has been his most continuous right
hand, and is now the test co-pilot. His future ministry will be
as instructor to missionary users of the plane. "I've learned
persistance from Dad and have grown in faith through his example.
God's direction in this has been reinforced now and again but
those in-between times can seem blurred. Still, Dad's vision is
always clear."

Last November as Carl and Evan put Angel through some of its
paces, a severe rudder flutter caught them by surprise: "We were
shaking violently," Carl recalls. "I had chopped the throttles
but the nose pitched up about 80 degrees in half a second, shot
up 1,000 feet in 4 seconds, and the left engine quit! The ac-
celerometer registered 6.5 Gs. Then the shaking stopped and we
were amazed to see the wings were still with us. We couldn't see
the tail and didn't know what we had to work with or what would
stay with us. For a few long seconds we fully expected to roll
over and dive straight into the ground. You can imagine how
blessed we felt as we gently recovered and found the plane was
actually flying quite well. Maybe the Lord sent real angels to
support us during that violent maneuver! We made a routine
single-engine landing. When we inspected the plane we discovered
the top of the rudder had broken above the hinge and folded over,
letting its heavy balance weight flutter. Nothing was wrong with
the left engine. I had inadvertently hit the feathering control
when I grabbed the throttles during the shaking. We had no damage
except for a few easily repaired skin wrinkles-- the plane's,"
Carl grins. "Again we think God was saying He had more for us and
the Angel to do. So that's what we're doing. At that point we
re-designed the rudder."

Carl Mortenson is 53, a low key man with blue eyes, a warm
smile and an incurable fondness for puns, spoonerisms and tongue
twisters. He's also single-minded, or as his family says,
stubborn. Does he ever wonder if he's crazy? Get disgusted? Make
wrong decisons? "Sure, but like the psalm says, the Lord
preserves the simple," he chuckles. "And yes, I do get frustrated
when we run out of money and everything grinds to a halt. Cash
flow is a wearer-downer. But God's clock is different. Sooner or
later He always moves His people to respond."

"Dad's work motto is: Do it. Do it right. Do it right now!"
says Dan. "But he also loves music, softball, humor and making
funny noises. The humor is never far away. He and Mom are just
two ordinary people who have given themselves completely to God's
service. And because of that they have a very fulfilling life."

Carl's wife, Alice, says, "People are always asking me what
it's like to live with an airplane. But we've done it so long it
seems perfectly normal to us. Oh, I get impatient to get things
repaired around the house. Here's all this mechanical know-how
and I can't get a lamp fixed! But planes have always been part of
the picture. Carl was rebuilding old planes when we married. He
donated a rebuilt Stinson to JAARS in Ecuador and we delivered it
On our way to Lima."

Does she worry when her husband and sons are flying an experi-
mental aircraft? "No," she answers softly. "I trust God. He's
demonstrated His presence and His will in this many times."

The Mortensons believe one of the things that keeps them
unified is their suppertime devotional. Every family member takes
a turn at leading it. Carl also established a tradition of daily
devotions in the shop.

The prototype Angel is now ready for structural testing, the
last requirement. A duplicate airframe must be built and tested
to destruction in the shop for final FAA certification for pro-
duction. It will be a cost-intensive phase. "Recently an ex-
ecutive from Cessna told me that no company would consider de-
signing and building a new aircraft for less than $15 million on
hand, not including production tooling which TKEF already has. To
date, The King's Engineering Fellowship has spent only half a
million. To us that seems like a lot." Carl sighs and poses a
question that's more of a statement. "How dare we expect to
finish a task like this? But we do, you know. There's only one
way. With God's help. Look how far we've come! But it's not what
we've done-- we're just instruments in His hands. We've had
hundreds of people praying for us all these years. And hundreds
of people making donations large and small. We've never been
alone. Prayer is so vital. One of our Supporters once mentioned
that she'd been especially burdened to pray for us on a certain
day. Turned out it was the day Evan and I almost crashed with the
rudder glitch."

The target date for going into production is Christmas of
1988. Some say it's impossible. He's heard that word before. But
Carl Mortenson's faith has passed all its flight tests and
there's still a twinkle in his eye.
